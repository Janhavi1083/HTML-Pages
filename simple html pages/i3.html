<h1>Information about i3 processor</h1>

<p><font size="5">Developed and manufactured by Intel, the Core i3 is a dual-core computer processor, available for use in both desktop and laptop computers. It is one of three types of processors in the "i" series (also called the Intel Core family of processors.</p>

<p>The Core i3 processor is available in multiple speeds, ranging from 1.30 GHz up to 3.50 GHz, and features either 3 MB or 4 MB of cache. It utilizes either the LGA 1150 or LGA 1155 socket on a motherboard. Core i3 processors are most often found as dual-core, having two cores. However, a select few high-end Core i3 processors are quad-core, featuring four cores.</p>

<p>The most common type of RAM used with a Core i3 processor is DDR3 1333 or DDR3 1600.</p>

</p>Power usage varies for the Core i3 processors:</p>
<ul type="square"><font size="5">
<li>Slower speeds (1.30 GHz to 1.80 GHz) use 11.5 W, 15 W or 25 W of power</li>
<li>Medium speeds (2.00 GHz to 2.50 GHz) use 28 W, 35 W or 37 W of power</li>
<li>Faster speeds (2.90 GHz to 3.50 GHz) use 35 W, 37 W or 54 W of power</li>

</ul>
<p>Core i3 processors are often used in laptop computers, due to their lower heat generation and conservative battery usage. Some laptops can be used for up to five or six hours on a single battery charge when running a Core i3 processor.</font></p>

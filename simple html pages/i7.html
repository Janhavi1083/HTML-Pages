<h1>Information about i7 processor</h1>

<p><font size="5">Intel Core i7 is a line of Intel CPUs which span eight generations of Intel chipsets. They feature either four or six cores, with stock frequencies between 2.6 and 3.7 GHz. The first i7 processors were released in November 2008 and new generations of the i7 continue to be released (2020).

<p>Variations of the i7 processor are manufactured for a variety of personal computing devices. Some high-performance i7 processors for desktop computers, such as the i7-8700K, are unlocked for overclocking. High-efficiency i7 processors (which conserve energy as much as possible, at the expense of some performance) are manufactured for desktop computers, laptops, and mobile devices.</p>

<p>The i7 processor is marketed primarily to gaming enthusiasts, and digital artists such as filmmakers and animators.</p>

<p>Limited edition i7-8086K:</p>

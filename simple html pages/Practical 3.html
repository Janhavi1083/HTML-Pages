<h1>What is Computer Programming ? </h1>
<p><font size="5">Computer programming is the process that professionals use to write code that instructs how a computer, application or software program performs. At its most basic, computer programming is a set of instructions to facilitate specific actions. Computer programmers create instructions for a computer to execute by writing and testing code that enables applications and software programs to operate successfully.Computers can do amazing things, from basic laptops capable of simple word processing and spreadsheet functions to incredibly complex supercomputers completing millions of financial transactions a day and controlling the infrastructure that makes modern life possible. But no computer can do anything until a computer programmer tells it to behave in specific ways. That’s what computer programming is all about. </p>

<h3>How to Become a Computer Programmer</h3>
<p><font size="5">Many computer programmers begin as self-taught enthusiasts. Dr. Ed Lavieri, began as a self-taught gamer, and served 25 years in the Navy before becoming a full-time teacher. As technical program facilitator of game programming and development, he said, “Computer programming becomes fun when you have the core knowledge.”Computer programming focuses on the use of programming languages, such as C++, Java, or HTML, to create various types of software. It is a more open-ended field, compared to other computer science fields like computer graphics, which focuses on visual arts, graphic images, and video; computer engineering, which focuses on the design and development of technology and hardware; or computer networking, which involves the communication between computers connected via a local area network and the internet.</p></font>

<h3> C programming</h3>
<p><font size="5">C helps you to understand the internal architecture of a computer, how computer stores and retrieves information.
After learning C, it will be much easier to learn other programming languages like Java, Python, etc.
Opportunity to work on open source projects. Some of the largest open-source projects such as Linux kernel, Python interpreter, SQLite database, etc. are written in C programming.</p></font>

<h3> C++ programming</h3>
<p><font size="5">C++ allows you to have a lot of control as to how you use computer resources, so in the right hands its speed and ability to cheaply use resources should be able to surpass other languages. Thanks to C++'s performance, it is often used to develop game engines, games, and desktop apps.</p></font>

<h3>Html & CSS</h3>
<p><font size="5">Having the knowledge to build your own website with HTML and CSS gives you the chance to stand out from the crowd with an authentic, hand-crafted representation of your business, or any business for that matter. Save money on every site you may want to build in the future, and build better websites with HTML and CSS</p></font>

<h3>Python</h3>
<p><font size="5">Python is one of the most loved programming languages by developers, data scientists, software engineers, and even hackers because of its versatility, flexibility, and object-oriented features. ... Although it's a high-level language and can do complex tasks, Python is easy to learn and has a clean syntax.</p></font>

<h3>Java programming</h3>
<p><font size="5">Java is a solid core language. ... For those in favor of learning Java first, a key factor is that it teaches you to think like a programmer. You'll learn the language, but you'll also learn some key underpinnings of programming as well. It's also an object oriented programming (OOP) language.</p></font>

<h3>Ruby</h3>
<p><font size="5">Ruby is a mature programming language and stable technology, bringing more to the picture than simply being 'trendy'. It is still possible to write bad code in Ruby, and some say it is fairly easy as the language is very flexible — it allows achieving the same result in multiple ways.</p></font>

<h1>Information about i5 processor</h1>

<p><font size="5">Developed and manufactured by Intel, the Core i5 is a computer processor, available as dual-core or quad-core. It can be used in both desktop and laptop computers, and is one of four types of processors in the "i" (Intel Core family) series. The first i5 processor was released in September 2009 and new generations of the i5 continue to be released (2020).
</p>

<p>The Core i5 processor is available in multiple speeds, ranging from 1.90 GHz up to 3.80 GHz, and it features 3 MB, 4 MB or 6 MB of cache. It utilizes either the LGA 1150 or LGA 1155 socket on a motherboard. Core i5 processors are most often found as quad-core, having four cores. However, a select few high-end Core i5 processors feature six cores.</p>

<p>The most common type of RAM used with a Core i5 processor is DDR3 1333 or DDR3 1600. However, higher performance RAM can be used as well if it's supported by the motherboard.</p>

</p>Power usage varies for the Core i5 processors:</p>
<ul type="square"><font size="5">
<li>Slower speeds (1.90 GHz to 2.30 GHz) use 11.5 W of power</li>
<li>Medium speeds (2.60 GHz to 3.10 GHz) use 15 W, 25 W, 28 W or 37 W of power</li>
<li>Faster speeds (3.20 GHz to 3.80 GHz) use 35 W, 37 W, 45 W, 47 W, 65 W or 84 W of power</li>
</font>
</ul>
<p>Core i5 processors are commonly found in desktop computers for most everyday use and some higher performance needs. Some laptop computers feature Core i5 processors as well, to provide improved performance for heavier usage needs. At the lower speeds, battery usage is pretty conservative and can reach up to five hours or usage on a single charge. However, at higher speeds, battery usage is higher and may result in up to three hours or so of usage per charge.
